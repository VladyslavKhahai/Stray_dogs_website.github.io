                    <p>For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger
                        that only he seems to be unaware of. Suspected to be behind the strange
                        incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left
                        hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.</p>
                    <p>
                        While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named 
                        Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural
                         detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been 
                         terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they 
                         solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As 
                         various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm 
                         of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot 
                         handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.

Very often, or rather constantly, he is cheerful and quite mad about the answers to his own questions, making it a real crime. Like Dostoevsky, Gogol also believes that he will be able to cleanse the current world of espers and paint it with blood.
